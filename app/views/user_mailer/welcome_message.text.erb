Dear <%= @user.username %>,

Welcome to Maze! We are so happy you have join our community as a founding member. 

Thank you for completing the short tutorial. You are now ready to start writing and supporting your fellow members on the Maze platform.

If you have any questions, you can revisit the tutorial at anytime or check the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), both located on the navigation menu on the left side of the screen. You can also contact us directly with any questions or concerns at support@Maze.com. 

The Maze site is currently free as we build our community. As a Thank You for being one of our founding members, you will get three months free once we start charging for access. You will be notified at least 30 days before we begin charging for access and your free three months will start from the day we start charging. So effectively you will get four months free!

Although we know most people prefer access to be free, creating a safe and positive environment to share and get support is one of our most important goals. A nominal monthly payment helps us to discourage and remove “Internet trolls” and negative behavior that cannot be accomplished on a free site. 

We ask for your patience as we build our community. The activity level of the platform is dependent on active members. The main reason we are not charging for access now is we know it will take some time to build up membership. We will not charge for access until we have an active community of members, bringing value to the platform and to you.

Please let us know if you have any ideas or suggestions for improvement. You can email us using the support email address listed above or you can use the Contact Us form when you are logged in to the Maze platform.

Thank you again for being a founding member!

The Maze Team
